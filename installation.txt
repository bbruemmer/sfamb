1. Installation

i) Install Ox on your computer (http://doornik.com/download.html). 
For execution of a sample file: 
go to the directory ./Program files/OxMetrics7/Ox/samples and
run a file such as myfirst.ox, using double click (or the command prompt).

ii) There are two folders, examples (data and script files)
and sfamb (the package's source code). Put sfamb into the directory Ox/packages.
The respective path is now Ox/packages/sfamb.

iii) Check the readme.txt file.

iv) If Ox has been installed properly, this will allow using the SFAMB 
package from any directory. To use the package in your code, add the command
#import <packages/sfamb/sfamb>
at the top of all files which require it, e.g. the file hbest1.ox
(the command #include <packages/sfamb/sfamb.ox> would also work).

v) Optional: SFAMB includes a function for graphics that can be used with the
Ox package GnuDraw (by Charles Bos, 
http://personal.vu.nl/c.s.bos/software/gnudraw.html).
The respective directory is again Ox/packages. Use the command 
#include <packages/gnudraw/gnudraw.h>
in your file, see e.g. hbest1.ox. 
Furthermore, this package requires the installation of gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/).
